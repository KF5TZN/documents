document describes an optional accessory shift-knob that supplies
meaningful input to the radio in order to allow the radio to
automatically change modes based on what type of downlink appears in the
receiver passband.

Energy detection?

Pilot signal classification?

Cyclostationary spectrum density (CSD) estimation?
