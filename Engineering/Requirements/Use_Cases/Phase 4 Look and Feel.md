Phase 4 Look and Feel
=====================

What Makes Phase 4 Feel Like Amateur Radio?
-------------------------------------------

With instant messaging, hangouts, Skype, and more cell phones than
people, the novelty of being able to communicate is not enough to make a
Phase 4 radio stand out from the crowd.

These questions get right to the heart of a problem that faces amateur
radio today. One can look at it as if ham radio has won. Ham radio
provided services that were rare on the ground a generation ago. Mobile
communications were enabled, auto patch provided POTS access over the
air, and packet radio provided keyboard-to-keyboard QSOs. All of these
things and more are now provided by commercial services. Cellphones, for
example, are so ubiquitous and pervasive that not having a cellphone is
more unusual in some cohorts than having one. In other words, commercial
services caught up to amateur radio.

One can also look at it as if ham radio has lost. Instead of picking up
a hands-on hobby that requires learning, everyone is essentially an
appliance operator in a world of closed-source hardware and software.

We believe in the first reality, but we acknowledge the many lessons of
the second.

Phase 4 Radios Enable Extreme Monitoring
----------------------------------------

The first and most powerful difference between Phase 4 and commercial or
commodity communications is that amateur radio means monitoring.
Communications are in the open, and anyone can listen to anyone else.
Phase 4 radios allow monitoring of everything going on in the system,
and this directly enables some powerful functionality. In order to take
advantage of this functionality, some visualization code and user
interface design is going to have to be written.

Examples
--------

The following are a few examples of the sort of things that can be done
when you are able to monitor everyone using a communications system.

> A map of everyone on the system at that moment.
>
> The statistics of everyone on the system at that moment in graphical
> or tabular form
>
> A “FractalQSL” record of all your QSOs with another operator.
>
> Everyone in a conference, placed in a stereo field, so that it sounds
> like you are in the middle of the group as they talk.
>
> Contests! Puzzles! Challenges! Collaborate and win.
>
> Visualization of ad hoc connections being made with other local Phase
> 4 radios.
