Wide-Field-of-View Payload Accommodations Study
===============================================

Request for Proposal

August 21, 2015

Project Summary
===============

> AMSAT wishes to participate in a ride-share opportunity as a hosted
> amateur radio payload on the Wide Field of View (WFOV) geosynchronous
> satellite currently being designed by Millennium Space Systems for the
> USAF Remote Sensing Program Office (USAF SMC/RS). A study shall be
> conducted by Millennium Space Systems to determine feasibility of the
> ride-share to determine the effects on the existing design.

Study Statement of Work
=======================

> The accommodations study will include the following elements:

1.  ### Payload Accommodations

    1.  #### *Accommodations: mechanical, location on spacecraft*

    2.  #### *Electrical Accommodations: harnessing, wiring, payload interface electronics, data, software, commanding, grounding, relays, dead-facing, keep-out zones – ensuring no failure of the AMSAT payload can propagate back to the spacecraft *

2.  ### Accommodations

    1.  #### *Develop a Preliminary Interface Control Document (ICD)*

    2.  #### *Develop a Preliminary Payload Integration Plan with Milestones, Dependencies and any work-around if payload delivery is late*

3.  ### Cost Estimate for Secondary Payload Integration onto WFOV

    1.  #### *Establish a Giver/Receiver List for both the study and for the follow-on integration & test program*

    2.  #### *Develop a Technical Risk Assessment in terms of any impacts to the baseline spacecraft design*

AMSAT Payload and CONOPS Description
====================================

> The AMSAT payload would consist of a software-defined radio,
> manufactured by RINCON Research Corporation, and additional electronic
> components needed to make it functional will come from Virginia Tech
> and AMSAT and shall be placed into operation in the amateur satellite
> service. It would be an FCC licensed, internationally coordinated
> digital transponder and bent pipe transponder.

### Frequency Bands: 

> 5660MHz uplink, \~10 MHz wide
>
> 10475 MHz downlink \~ 10 MHz wide

1.  ### Modes of Operation

    The payload would implement a digital transponder and a bent pipe
    transponder using a channelized uplink (frequency division
    multiplexed) and would divide these channels between digital uplinks
    and bent pipe uplinks based on demand and as coordinated but will be
    settable by the operators to best fit the available channel capacity
    as USAF WFOV changes position around the earth. The downlink will
    consist of a single carrier digital signal and a single frequency
    band producing an FDM linear transponder (bent pipe).

2.  ### Power

    Initial discussions indicated an available 100+ W. We need maximum
    possible transmit power so we proposed to consume every available
    watt but stay beneath the power cap. We propose that the operators
    of USAF WFOV simply turn our transponder off when there is
    insufficient power to operate our payload as opposed to our increase
    in complexity of making multiple power settings at this time. This
    can be reconsidered in cooperation with MSS.

3.  ### Mass

    Initial discussions indicated a maximum payload allowance of up to
    20 Kg of mass. We propose to build a total payload that is
    significantly less than 20 Kg total mass, inclusive of antennas,
    electronics, and cables.

4.  ### Size

    Mass volume allowed or actual envelope size is currently unknown. We
    foresee a very small footprint on the cold plate for thermal
    control, and small footprint external to the body of the USAF WFOV
    bus for our antennas.

5.  ### Antennas

    The current CONOP utilizes short horns operating in the 10 GHz
    amateur satellite service allocation and will have a half power beam
    width that will subtend the visible earth. The receive antenna
    concept is a phased array consisted to two separate flat panels
    mounted on the available space adjacent to the nadir pointing face
    but consisting of one each panel, mounted on the +X and –X face. The
    10 GHz band will need at least two horns, one for the digital
    transponder and one for the bent pipe transponder.

6.  ### Payload Operation

    We propose the only control needed by AMSAT is power on/power off.
    We plan to command and control the payload in-band using the digital
    uplink with our payload doing decryption, verification, and
    identification. We will downlink telemetry from our payload on the
    digital downlink. This can and will include any digital data needed
    by the primary mission. We propose no need for any data from our
    payload to be transmitted for our payload to any system already on
    USAF WFOV. There will be zero contact between our digital system and
    our data and the USAF WFOV payloads. We will provide, in
    coordination with MSS, analog signals consisting of telemetry points
    from our payload that MSS wishes us to incorporate.
