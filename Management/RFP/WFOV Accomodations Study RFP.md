**Project Summary**

> Radio Amateur Satellite Corp. (“AMSAT”) wishes to participate in a
> ride-share opportunity as a hosted amateur radio payload on a
> geosynchronous satellite currently being designed by Millennium Space
> Systems (MSS). This request is for a study to be conducted by
> Millennium Space Systems to determine feasibility of the ride-share
> and to determine the effects on the existing design of the satellite.
